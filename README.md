This repository contains a C++ program that monitors the execution time of tasks across multiple stages. The program records the time taken for each stage, compares it against a predefined threshold, and logs any exceedances in a persistent log file. Communication between processes is achieved using named pipes (FIFO).

## ‚öô Features

- Multi-stage task execution with time monitoring
- Logging of time exceedances in a persistent file
- Inter-process communication using named pipes (FIFO)
- Simulation of task execution with randomized delays

## üåê Program Description

The program includes the following functionality:

1. **Time Monitoring**: Tracks the execution time of each task stage and compares it to a maximum allowed time (3 seconds).
2. **Log File Management**: Records instances where a stage exceeds the time limit in a log file (`execution_log.txt`), which is appended with each run.
3. **Named Pipe Communication**: Uses a FIFO pipe (`/tmp/time_pipe`) for inter-process communication to report stage completion times.
4. **Process Management**: Spawns separate processes for each task stage using `fork()` and handles cleanup on termination.


## üíª Used Technologies

- **C++** (standard library for I/O, filesystem, and process management)
- **POSIX APIs** (for process creation, named pipes, and time management)
- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC) with POSIX support

## üêã Installation
